    <h2>Description for Cooking a Lobster</h2>
    <p>
        Nothing can get simpler than this, boiled lobsters is as easy as placing live ones on boiling water and wait for 15 minutes. I know some are against using live lobsters that is why we dunk head first to the boiling water so they donâ€™t suffer much.

    <p>
        Most of the time simple does not equate to a feast except if its lobsters. This seafood is quite expensive in most places hence preparing this even with the simplest recipe can be equated as a feast.
